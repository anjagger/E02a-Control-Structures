# E02a-Control-Structures

This is a excerise for class to help better understand codes.

- Open main01.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do?
  - Blue. The print called it to say greeting and then input allowed you to type you answer next to the question. I think it might have stored it away for future reference.

- Open main02.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main01.py.
  - It actually has a code which will output the color that your inputed for the question. So I should get the color that I type in repeated back to me. Blue. It did exactly what I thought it would.

- Open main03.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main02.py.
  - Instead of allowing you to choose a color, you have to guess the correct color. Which in this case is red. Lines 9-12 is exactly like the guessing game with number that we done except this guess is not random we will be able get in correct serval times. Lines 10 and 12 are indented because if theyd were not indented they would automatically read them off even if those certain conditions are not met. If you don't capitalize red it will tell you that you are wrong. It mean that the color now has to be red and capitalized.

- Open main04.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main03.py.
  - It allows red to be capitalized or not. It tell you you are not correct if you use any other capitalization sheme than what is listed in the code.

- Open main05.py. What do you expect line 9 to do?
  - Line 9 is trying to solve the capitalization sheme issue. It again tells you that you are wrong.
 
 - Open main06.py. How is line 9 different than in main05.py?
   - It has strip in it so I think this will fix the space issue.
   What would you guess .strip() is doing? Red. If you put a space in between each letter it will break this logic.
   
 - Open main07.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main06.py?
   - It now tells you that pink is close to the color. Red.
 
 - Open main08.py. What is the purpose of line 9?
   - Line 9 basically puts red under a catagory. Lines 10-17 are indented because they are conditions for red.
   If line 10 was before 9 and not indented you would not beable to use red to get it to say correct. It decided that it wanted to keep saying sorry you didn't get it right if you used a color that wasn't red and if it was red it did nothing.
  
 - Open main09.py. What is happening on line 13?
   - Line 13 has a count which tells you how many times it took you to guess the color. Line 21 Actually says the words "it took you said amount of trys to guess the anwser.
 - *Extra credit:* open main10.py. Add a comment to each line describing what it is doing (a comment follows a pound sign [#]).
 - *Extra credit:* open main11.py. What is happening on lines 6-11?
